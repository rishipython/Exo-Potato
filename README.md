# Exo-Potato
Exo-Potato is a software for deep space exoplanet hunting that uses machine learning. It predicts whether or not a star has an exoplanet orbiting it based on the change in flux (light frequency) data. The model used was a KNN and it obtained a 98% accuracy on the test set. The UI is a website that was made with Django, HTML, and CSS. It takes in a .csv file from the user and gets the change in flux data from that file. It then shows whether or not an exoplanet is orbiting the planet and a graph of the change in flux.
